Hemato is wearing black shoes, khaki brown jeans, and a black tee shirt. Ehena has a blue tee shirt, khaki brown short shorts, and a pair of birkenstocks. She wears one lopsided blue bow.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />You couldn't always rely on people from European<br />backgrounds to teach you language. In Ehena's case, her being 1.5<br />generation French but with a Japanese mother. meant that<br />she did know more French than those in the second generation,<br /> but not as much as a first generation. Yet curiously know almost know Japanese, so she was no help there. I would always imagine her saying: </p>
<p class="dialogue"><i>EHENA<br />Hey about you just teach me English instead, who needs to learn French afterall.</i></p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Like people in Seattle, you never really know if they were even going<br />to be friendly enough to even be willing to teach even a close friend a language,<br /> or do things that would make learning languages more difficult.<br/> Yet Ehena was one of the few exceptions, when all other French girls,<br /> would label me as being "ugly cute". My resentment from this consuming one in entire: <br />
<p class="verse">Like being ran over with tires.</p>
<p class="verse">Splatter. Pop goes the weasel.</p>
<p class="verse">Boom box bursting the voice box.</p>

<p class="verse">And all the patience in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Even in a world like ours,</p>
<p class="verse">When it could end at any moment.</p><br /><br />

<p class="verse">With me and her, there was silence,</p>

<p class="scenetitle">SCENE 24 RECESS DESCRIMINATION</p>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato Tomato and and a girl she knew name Stephanie were in Fifth grade recess.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO ( Narrator )<br />I’ve had issues with blond girls ever since I met the one French-American<br /> and Spanish-American girls back in fifth grade. The impression I had gotten was that in general, while both Latinas<br /> hated attractive people , they both liked “Ugly Men”. There were several reasons why this was an issue, but let’s<br />first begin with the statement and judgment call we call “Ugly”. In American contemporary usage, and this permeates across various fields of life, including fashion; the word<br />ugly carries the meaning of being unattractive. The word homely began being used in the same way during my era, even though it had originally meant<br />“someone I want to take home with me." It didn’t seem like there was enough of their<br />immigrant background for them not to realize this American context.<br />It was one thing for Bianca to treat me this way, as I had once<br />confused her for a Mexican (kids say that kind of stupid shit all the time).<br />But with Stephanie, there was no possible way for her to think<br />I was confusing her for anybody. It was a grudge I had hidden for<br />all the years of my life. I felt totally betrayed, because I liked French girls.<br />I wanted to reject all Romance languages. My ex, whom I had known<br />in trans support group, emotionally manipulated these issues further,<br />and wanted to manipulate me into being something of a Francophobe. It took at the strength I had.<br />But I also had a darker secret.</p>
<p class="verse">ONLY SLIGHT DIFFERENCE</p>
<p class="verse">I was ugly to her,</p>
<p class="verse">with only slight bit</p>
<p class="verse">of difference.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">Ugly cute was what she said,</p>
<p class="verse">then she gave me the boot.</p>
<p class="verse">The image of her being blond,</p>
<p class="verse">was burned into permanent memory.</p>
<p class="verse">Like data that can never be shredded.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">It became my fantasy, to watch them be beheaded,</p>
<p class="verse">dissolving into bits data.</p>
<p class="verse">I was the defender, they were the bug.</p>
<p class="verse">All the time in the world to squash them.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">A little bit of hate, goes a long way,</p>
<p class="verse">During which one can masturbate.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">I didn't need her, and she didn't need me.</p>
<p class="verse">Because I was ugly cute, she was a swan.</p>
<p class="verse">And I was a butcher, with an executioner for a father.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">Don't mind me, while I associate you with Latin,</p>
<p class="verse">While I butcher your names in pig Latin.</p>
