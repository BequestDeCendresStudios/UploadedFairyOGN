  <h1 class="playtitle">Uploaded Fairy: Hemato's Story Act 4</h1>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 21 Life Is A Game Of Deadly Chess Masters PART ONE</h3>
<h3 class="scenedescription">Hemato Tomato is in a miltiary cemetary near the train. She is using large stones like pawns in a game of chess. The sky in the backdrop is painted red, with all the graveyard illumminated like a Silhouette.</h3>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />To remember the smell of sweat and tears.</p>
<p class="dialogue">KAT MAC<br />Have you ever thought of writing for erotica magazines, you sure have the sex drive for it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />My body returning to the midnight forest, where wolves hunt the deer, and bears for the fish.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />To see Anna-Marie again.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Instead I dreamed of snoring on a motel bed, the texture of fallen hair on the floor.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />The uncleaned dishes that were only washed in the bath tube.</p>
<p class="diloauge">KAT MAN<br />Or am I renting to much head space?</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 22 Life Is A Game Of Deadly Chess Masters PART TWO</h3>
<p class="narration">HEMATO<br />I woke up in the hospital, in a daze. The doctor said that I had been out for a week.
<p class="narration">HEMATO<br />I was more worried that they could peer into my mind, using a dream-scanning machine, dreams of silent hills and ghosts of another past, merging into a collective group of various government entities in the verge between life and death.</p>
<p class="narration">For some people, what they see is a tunnel of light, but for me it was always night. Except for me and my angel.</p>
<p class="narration">My Anna-Marie. The girl who wore a lopsided bow, and at other times a flower in her hair.</p>
<p class="narration">As we snuggled under the moonlight, dreaming of fireflies and lady bugs.</p>
<p class="narration">A dream of being with her again, as I lay beyond the mortal life.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />No, Iâ€™m just thinking about something else.</p>
<p class="verse">CHESS MASTERS</p>
<p class="authornotes">This song is written primarily in Locrian, but with appegiation in Ionian in the key of C.</p>
<p class="verse">Its a game of</p>
<p class="verse">deadly chess, love like</p>
<p class="verse">a crashing van, all</p>
<p class="verse">the blood flying in a fan.</p>
<p class="verse">Rotting in old trash can.</p><br /> <br/>
<p class="verse">You go now, in memories.</p>
<p class="verse">Where once was tranguility.</p>
<p class="verse">Instead of an oncoming van.</p>
<p class="verse">Your nothing but a dying breath,</p>
<p class="verse">Memories suffocation.</p><br /> <br/>
<p class="verse">Its a game of</p>
<p class="verse">deadly chess, love like</p>
<p class="verse">a crashing van, all</p>
<p class="verse">the blood flying in a fan.</p>
<p class="verse">Rotting in old trash can.</p><br /> <br/>
<p class="verse">Its a game of blood and necks,</p>
<p class="verse">Of blowjobs and chopping blocks.</p>
