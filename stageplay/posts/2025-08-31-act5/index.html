  <h1 class="playtitle">Uploaded Fairy: Hemato's Story Act 5</h1>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 22 Love Like Crashing On A Motorcycle</h3>
<h3 class="scenedescription">Hemato-Tomato imagines herself taking cyanide pills, while driving off the ride on a motorcycle. She flips off into a giant crator, left-over from when France had violently taken over the outer regions of NashChat.</h3>
<p class="narration">HEMATO<br />There were times I wished I had not met this girl named Desire,<br />although she didn't kickstart my issue with blond.</p>
<p class="narration">My issue with French girls was indirect, and not the easiest to identify.<br />We had met each other on websites where you could take<br/>personality quizes, although some used them as dating websites.<br />This was before the French had taken over my city,<br />It in had an inhibiting factor before I had met Ehena, who<br />completely changed my views about the language.</p>
<p class="narration">And yet now here is, six under. While I hold, her severe dhead. As it drips with blood.</p>
<p class="dialogue">DESIRE<br />So when you see you like girls in Birkenstocks?<br />( She briefly holds back the second portion.<br />Do you mean you like only girls because they wear Birkenstocks?</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />I don’t, but what if I said I did?</p>
<p class="narration">I built up this suspicion of the idea that in general girls who were of French heritage didn’t like to be challenged. More so they any other person of female gender.</p>
<p class="narration">My body was object, rotten meat, I caved into my own desires.</p>
<p class="authornotes">This song is compared of the Bb Diminished, B Minor, Eb Diminished, and D Major chords for melodic bridges. A modication of the ice cream changes chord progression is made for darker chords that reminds one of soap operas from the 1950s. But it needs to march sort of like Flamenco music.</p>
<p class="verse">FEEDING THE SPIDER</p>
<p class="verse">Love was like a</p>
<p class="verse">broken motorcycle on</p>
<p class="verse">lonely highway.</p>
<p class="verse">With nobody to call,</p>
<p class="verse">to help you up from pain.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">We turn inside the mind,</p>
<p class="verse">And find a spider, spinning a web.</p>
<p class="verse">And yet the spider, also needs to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Inside the mind, where web is weaving,</p>
<p class="verse">He forms a delicate sheet.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">Love was like a</p>
<p class="verse">broken motorcycle on</p>
<p class="verse">lonely highway.</p>
<p class="verse">With nobody to call,</p>
<p class="verse">to help you up from pain.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">That death near in flash bright,</p>
<p class="verse">the awkward pasue, when one is without words.</p>
<p class="verse">As the emergency lights, breaks the ambiance.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">To help with the pain,</p>
<p class="verse">I take the cyanide pills,</p>
<p class="verse">And feed the spider, in the mind.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 23 No Breads To Share</h3>
<h3 class="scenedescription">Imagine a brothers grim like fantasy setting, that Hemato-Tomato imagines herself in. This world functions as her personal escape, from the torment that is her life as an apprentice executioner. Blood spatter is on the straw that covers the streets that lead to the castle.</h3>
<p class="narrative">HEMATO<br />You may wonder, if the technology were available, why I would personally choose not time travel</p>
<p class="narrative">HEMATO<br />The reason is simple, whenever I wrote about time travel at a<br />young age, it was a matter of allowing myself the witness the<br />execution of my beloved princess within the pages of a digital LitRPG novel.</p>
<p class="narrative">HEMATO<br />There was something about the flow of blood, draining from their severed neck.<br />And the feeling of fluid that once gave life feeding my inner core.<br />In traditional Vampire lore, the vampire is the one that drains the blood.</p>
<p class="narrative">And yet now blood no longer feeds me, and I resist to vomit.</p>
<p class="narraitve">With the execution of a French girl, her neck slowly lowering<br />into the stock of the guillotine, it was the idea of not<br />having to kill them myself. For deep down, I knew that, as I watched<br />in horror as my father raised up the blade on beloved ...<br /> that part of me did not really want them to die despite the desire to not see it happen,<br />that reveled in the eye of seeing ones dark brown almost black locks<br />fall inside the wicker basket, where other revolutionary heads of women have been before.<p>
<p class="authornotes">This song should feel tonally different from the previous song, indicating the sweeter and more innocent nature Hemato thought Ehena ( Anna ) Marie had. The time signature is 6/4 time, however the base melody the chords rests on are based on an inversion of Bb Ionian sus. However the chord progressive needs to be based on the Royal Road Progression. But with some slight tweaks: it needs to account for the fact that the scale follows these intervals: B-C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb-B. One easy way of developed the angelic sound is D Sus Triads. These chord progression should avoid clashing with this while lending a darker sound. Then cascade into a more aggressive sounding Double Harmonic Minor sound in triadic appregiation. Then end with a tear jerker triad.</p>
<p class="verse">In my own personal lore, I dream of vampire queens, and werewolves Kings.
<p class="verse">Yet in these dreams of dreams, I knew that, despite my own inner lust,
<p class="verse">that I would never be that demon.
<p class="verse">Midnight eclipse falling, the rotation of the Earth,
<p class="verse">Allowing for a certain gravitic lunar frequency for my inner lust.
<p class="verse">The lust for sharpened bloody axes and angular guillotine blades gone to rust.
<p class="verse">The flow of gentle chest covered in genial tears.
<p class="verse">The best beheading of a French girl I had seen all my years.
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />But the reality was, I was not a vampire. I was only one in the desire for blood.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />For me and my Marie, there was no baguettes to share.</p>
<p class="verse">ZOMBIE QUEEN IN WHITE</p>
<p class="verse">I hated others,</p>
<p class="verse">and I thought they hated</p>
<p class="verse">me. And yet for them</p>
<p class="verse">it was as if they werent</p>
<p class="verse">aware of any ill thought.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">For my life as</p>
<p class="verse">an executioners</p>
<p class="verse">apprentice, no</p>
<p class="verse">thought of despair was a</p>
<p class="verse">thing discussed.</p><br /><br />
<p class="verse">And yet sense you've been gone</p>
<p class="verse">my lady in white, Marie,</p>
<p class="verse">My life has no been free.</p>
<p class="verse">Free from your memory.</p>
<p class="verse">My zombie queen in white.</p><br /><br />
