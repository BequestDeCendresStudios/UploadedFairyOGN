  <h1 class="playtitle">Uploaded Fairy: Hemato's Story Act 2</h1>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 13 - SCHOOl CLUB</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato and Ehena are having dinner time at school club, during Dance Dance Revolution Night. They both are splitting a Lasagna together, noting the awful irony of a French girl eating Lasagna rather some Crepes.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />How is your lasagna Ehena?</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">There were things taught to me in my early high school years, that if they became true...</p>
<p class="dialogue">it was uncertain how much longer the United States as an empire would continue to exist.</p>
<p class="dialogue">EHENA<br />Tres bien, et toi?</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEAMTO<br />C'est tres bien.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Already in my life at that point, I had seen the withdrawal of troops from the middle East. Donald Trump was trying to start an economic war with Mexico, and nobody really quite knew what he would do next.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">I just hoped the he would not try to keep me and my Anna from moving back to Alsace, France.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 14 - Foreign Wars Overseas And South Of Border</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">France is rejecting migrants from Caravans, while the United States has a military strike campaign against the Mexican border.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">There were limits to what European countries found acceptable, and many countries were beginning to reject new people into their countries:</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Already there were several groups of wandering Romani groups that were deported from Romania to France, which caused a large stink, because it violated EU protocols.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Say what you want about large economic institutions, their seemingly infinite propensity to roll back people’s freedom made it an increasing rate was a grim alternative move in Europe. Perhaps Europe was not much different afterall.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 15 - School Parking Lot</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">A few months during their Sophomore year, Hemato had offered a ride for Ehena, because she wasn’t sure when her father was going to come to school. In the parking lot, Hemato-Tomato and Ehena-Marie are waiting for mom to arrive. Ehena never talked much about her mother. The radio is talking about Brexit.<p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll give you a ride this time, but after I never want to see you with my son again.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">HEMATO<br />Even for Anna-Marie, she had lived in the United States long enough, her father a first generation French immigrant, that it might be a hard sell to go back to her old home country voluntarily. For those, there was only one way for her to go. Her head into a wicker basket.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 16 - Later In The Week</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Later in the week, they are hanging out after school playing TTRPGs, as her favourite could not afford a game console. The game this week vaguely reminded Hemato-Tomato of poorly written 90s Fantasy movies. Later Hemato imagine herself with Ehena holding her from behind riding a black stallion into the sunset. And visited a childhood lake under the cover a red moonlight.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">But with me and Anna, there was nothing separating us. There was a certain level of trust we had that simply was not there among our family members.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">It was one of the few months we got to see each other, and some nights I would worry about her, do to the little bit of information that I knew about her father.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Because we both saw in each other, something more. Something we didn’t want to admit.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Because we both new, despite our different backgrounds, that nothing would separate us by our own volition. Even father… Oh my father. Who was a headsman and a half</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Even if that meant dating a common criminal.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 16 – TATTOO PARLOR</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato-Tomato, months after the death of Ehena-Marie, is getting a tatto of her likeness to remember her by. Hemato sits in a chair, waiting for the tattoo artist to insert the needle. Hemato was already able to drive a motorized scooter. While others preferred motorcycles, she had the final laugh, when she could simply plug her transportation in. And not have to worry about Gas prices. While we normally think of the civil rights era, in terms of figures like Martin Luther King, perhaps an even greater tragedy was the gradual rising of gas prices. It wasn’t terribly expensive back then. Yet now scientist are discussing about climate catastrophe by the time 2050 rolls around.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Francaise hanasemasu ka?</p>
<p class="dialogue">ARTIST<br />Non, parlez vous Nihongo?</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Only a little. You the QR code will scan properly?</p>
<p class="dialogue">ARTIST<br />Relax Hemato, with this technology, there wont be any mistakes.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />That hurts like a bitch.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 17 – Home From The Parlor</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">At home, Hemato cringes slightly with the pain of her new QR code. She hoped that it would actually scan her identity information, and a local host address to bounce back to home server. It seemed like everyone was sporting a tattoo these days, though few seem to enjoy the spectacle of being scanned by their phones.</p>
<p class="dialogue">TELEVISION: On tonight’s gossip, ex actress wins deal for new soft core animation.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 17 – HOSPITAL – A WEEK EARLIER - Song: Secret Lair</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato is resting on the emergency room, because she crashed her motorized scooter. They replaced the arm with a robotic one with QR code on a 3D printed prosthesis, grown from her own cells. Said technology could also lead to regrowing human bodies, particularly in cases of mistaken execution. But only the rich could afford it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( In her mind, dancing to a harpsichord of death and rot)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I miss you so much. Why can’t you be here?</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 17 – Darkness In Hemato's Head</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">An older Hemato-Tomato is floating in a void of darkness, reaching out for an invisible hand that was Ehena's Marie's.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />It is never easy to discuss one’s own vulnerabilities. Whether that is for the death of your beloved pet, your favorite uncle, or your wife from a malignant cancer.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Some deaths are inevitable, and yet others feel less preordained because of the overwhelming sense of the present moment.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />While it was easy for me to not grasp this when I had tried topping myself so many times in my young life, somehow when it involves someone else, the feeling puts you in an even greater depression than if you had never met the love you thought you'd spend the rest of your days with.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />That feeling of total helplessness, that total lack of the innocuous; the overwhelming feeling of being the only one left in the world.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />For me, I was a vampire who lived with a family of humans. For she never knew the extent for my taste for blood, and only hid this to protect her from the darker aspects of my own personality.</p>
<p class="verse">LIFE LIKE SWEET ROSE METAL</p>
<p class="verse">Life is sweet roses,
<p class="verse">Sweet rose metal, on a bed of thorns.
<p class="verse">For me, in my life for my profession scorned.
<p class="verse">I shall be the last of executioners.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Life like sweet rose metal,
<p class="verse">The taste of my lovers blood in my mouth.
<p class="verse">To think that someone so seemingly innocent,
<p class="verse">could harbor many a secret.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Life is sweet roses,
<p class="verse">Sweet rose metal, on a bed of thorns.
<p class="verse">For me, in my life for my profession scorned.
<p class="verse">I shall be the last of executioners.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">For you my sweet princess,
<p class="verse">Let down your severed head, with your luscious hair.
<p class="verse">While we wander into my secret lair.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If only life could flow like sweet rose metal, and not like thorns. Yet sometimes the rose petals are mixed within, that feeling of pain and regret all over again.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 18 – The Downtown Graveyard</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Sometimes Hemato could see the spirit of the dead in her dreams, and wake up constantly with screams and breathlessness. She would reach out for some hidden hand of a love that is no longer present there.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />To think, instead, that the real world treats us like monsters.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />The villains in old western movies; movies of young damsels being ran over with a train.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Yet my mind feels like I walked right into the train tracks from the get go, my world not letting me die in peace to once again be with my beloved.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />The feeling of earthly estrangement drawing nearer and nearer with no end in sight.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />The feeling of being a pawn in a game of chess.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />My relationship with Anna was not the best.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Nor the worst. It was what we had with indifferent parents. And sometimes the indifference is the worst. What people call a split personality, is simply extensive compartmentalization; everyone does it, some better than others. For me, this manifests as different applications, on a local machine.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 19 – Classroom</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato Tomato is in a classroom looking at this one girl that reminded her of Ehena, except with cropped strawberry blond hair. She was a very different type of voice from Anna-Marie, who stayed in the side-lines never speaking to anyone. It was almost as if she was a ghost in the class. Yet became more talkative in art class.</p>
<p class="dialogue">STRAWBERRY BLOND GIRL<br />Oh shit now, I knew I shouldn’t have cropped my hair.</p>
<p class="authornotes">Perhaps there is a lot I could go into here, but to be honest, I’m not a hubzilla or friendica profile. This isn’t the first draft of somebody’s trashy romance novel, written on a pop fiction website for hopeless romantics.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />I may be a hopeless romantic, but I’m not so hopeless as to lower myself to that, while subsequently uploading the same content in which I rant, on a shitty writing website geared to us.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">It is a story of my own sensuality, with everything between love and hate.</p>
<p class="dialogue">French girl have their own allure, and your not Ehena.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">For Anna-Marie, her allure is in death.</p>
