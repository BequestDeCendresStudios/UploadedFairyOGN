<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 1 - COMPUTER NETWORK ROOM</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato-Tomato is uploading her mind to the super computer inside the network chamber. Inside her mind, she remembered the last bits of dialogue from the girl she tried to save. >It was 2050 A.D. The two civil wars were finally over, leaving behind a French colonial state from Maine all the way to California.</p>
<p class="dialogue">RINALDA<br />Wait, where are you taking me?</p>
<p class="dialogue">MOTHER<br />To be privately executed. We’re financing your beheading.</p>
<p class="dialogue">RINALDA<br />But mom, why?</p>
<p class="dialogue">MOTHER<br />Just like my mother would have done, if I committed murder.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 2 – MOTHER’S OFFICE</h3>
<p class="dialogue">MOTHER</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( Writing in a notebook, a letter to the warden. )</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear prison keeper, I would be more than happy to finance my daughter’s own execution. That can save you the expense, and my daughter can die humanely. I still have doubts about her guilt, but at least I know she wont suffer.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 3 – EXECUTION CHAMBER – GUILLOTINE</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">RINALDA, with her arms bound behind her back, wearing an orange prison jump suit and orange ankle socks, is tied onto the table, then guillotine gun uses a procedural pathway to roll in her direction.</p>
<p class="dialogue">EXECUTIONER (On the intercom):</br />Rinalda, you’ve been sentenced to death for the murder of your sister. Do you have any last words?</p>
<p class="dialogue">RINALDA<br />Please, just let me die quickly.</p>
<p class="scenedescription">>From her perspective, we see the whisker basket, where her severed head shall soon be. The angular blade quickly lowers, slicing through her neck. Blood pours from the blade, her head with blond locks falling down.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">SCENE 4 – COMPUTER NETWORK ROOM</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">>Hemato cringes in anguish. Then after she was uploaded, found her personality slowly begin to fragment. She saw flashbacks of times when she would go to the festivals and fares with her.</p>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato woke up in total blackness. Before her was the mirror of herself.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Hemato, you know it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( Hemato smokes an electronic cigarillo.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can punish humanity together.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />But what about the others?</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( Points to the guards attempting to rescue to hijacked computer chamber.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />I will deal with them.</p>
<p class="authornotes">Hemato's theme should be written in Double Harmonic Minor, using Bebop like chord progressions.</p>
<p class="verse">Verse
<p class="verse">I am Hemato<br />
<p class="verse">with taste for blood.<br />
<p class="verse">The midnight hour<br />
<p class="verse">approaches, with a man<br />
<p class="verse">in a dark black hood.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">To think mankind now, has become as this.<br />
<p class="verse">The days long now past, I come to now miss.<br />
<p class="verse">So long the girl with a lopsided bow.<br />
<p class="verse">The blade comes down on you, in death row.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Chorus<br />
<p class="verse">The woman in black, with a guillotine in row,<br />
<p class="verse">the lady of death, lurking in the shadows tow.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Verse<br />
<p class="verse">Long ago, when it was her and me,<br />
<p class="verse">I had once wanted to be, from death I shall be free.<br />
<p class="verse">Yet now I wait, upon my knees, for the night to pass,<br />
<p class="verse">For my frail heart is made of glass.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">I am Hemato<br />

<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 5. Mes Nom De Plume Es Hemato Tomato</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato Tomato is washing off the blade her father used to publicly guillotine her girlfriend. She shivers down her spine, and tries to wash herself off, but the cloth is bloody and unuseable.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO TOMATO<br />
My name is Hemato-Tomato, I have a thing for blood.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I used to think it was for decapitation, then I met the love of my life.</p>
<p class="verse">I wanted to be her shining knight, sing her soft lullabies at night.</p>
<p class="verse">But I had my own issues that made this difficile.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I once thought I liked dead girls...
<p class="dialogue">but it wasn’t their rot and stink that appealed to me.</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was the idea of being able to hold and embrace them, even if we never met.</p>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato-Tomato pictures the severed roll roll off the shoulders of murdersses guillotined.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If not for the fact that I wanted to see their severed heads roll off their shoulders.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I think I’m cured now, for the most part anyway.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 6. The Bowling Allys Le Mort</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato Tomato is using the severed head of Ehena Marie as a bowling ball for bowling pens in an abandoned bowling alley.</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was a time when I wanted to use them as bowling balls in some imaginary game of bowling, imagining others clapping to their demise, tap dancing in their bowling shoes.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But more importantly I didn’t like the idea of being rejected by someone I liked.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought this was because I didn’t want to be alone, that dead girls could not reject you.
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato Tomato visits the gravestone of the executed Ehena Marie in the after hours of the graveyard.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the only one rejecting me was myself. For I only, in all this strange new world, had myself.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 7. Lost In My Own Digital Sexuality</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">An abstract stage set up with gothic houses painted as if they were crying majestic tears of an angel.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wept tears beyond mortal tears....<p>
<p class="dialogue">beyond the ones that most people will ever have to face.
<p class="dialogue">The tears of shame and guilt, and falling in disgrace.</p>
<p class="verse">Falling down into a pit below,
<p class="verse">away from the Kingdom by the sea.
<p class="verse">And for me, and my Bride Anna-Marie,
<p class="verse">there was only death.
<p class="dialogue">I wanted a special kingdom for my beloved pride,
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( Hemato-Tomato takes a shuffle, and begins digging up the grave. )
<p class="dialogue">far beyond the cruelties of this world we call Earth, in some country called France or the United States, or what had remained of it.
<p class="dialogue">When the French had taken over what the remnants.</p>
<p class="verse">Lost in my own digital sexuality,</p>
<p class="verse">I prepared for the fall.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But this girl out of time, who would let let me die by her side in this tomb of all tombs, had something else in mind for me.</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is our story:</p>
<p class="verse">And in this Kingdom by the Southern sea,</p>
<p class="verse">Where sand was white and green.</p>
<p class="verse">Beyond the pale horse, with his scythe,</p>
<p class="verse">Slicing you in your spleen.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wanted something different, partially to satisfy my own sexuality.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But there was some part of my that didn’t want to admit, that I had fallen in love with this girl that I had grown up with...
<p class="dialogue">whom had rejected me, based on this accursed interests in the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">I wanted something more.</p>
<p class="verse">Not just her head.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 8. A Final Goodbye</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato and her father are escorted Ehena ( Anna-Marie ) out of her prison cell to the guillotine.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />
<p class="thoughtbubbles">Don’t look at me like that Anna.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t date girls simply to cut their heads off.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ehena-Marie<br />
<p class="dialogue">Maybe not, but look at the stars tonight.
<p class="thoughtbubbles">pulling out a joint to puff into the wind.
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t that curious?
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( She gives me the middle finger, and then went on her way. )
<p class="dialogue">What I way to spend a final goodbye.</p>
<p class="authornotes">They had had issues for some time since they had turned fifteen, but they began seeing each other less once I they reached the age of eighteen.<p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 9. Montage Of Capital Punishment Methods</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">We are presented with a montage of different methods of capital punishment sense 1793, ranging from French Quartering, Breaking On The Wheel, and other methods that the guillotine was originally meant to be a liberal progression from. Also a montage of methods the Japanese empire executed prisoners of war. The montage ends with Ehena Marie and Hemato-Tomato puffing joints in the backyard on a starry night overlooking Downtown Nashchat.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">And now I live with the guilt. I wish she was still here. Its was 2016, and you wouldn't think there would still be decapitation. And there wasn't until the rise of the National Front in Europe. And the rise of far right parties in Japan.<p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">I didn’t think I’d fall in love with a parricidal girl, but that was the deck of an uneven fifty two given to my tungue.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">A tungue that months previously had preferred replaced licking the swan like neck of Ehena-Marie.<p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO<br />Life doesn’t give us in such easy wins.</p>
<p class="dialogue">EHENA-MARIE<br />But that'a our luck.<p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 10. Life In High School</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato-Tomato has an overgrown straightened afro, that looks like an unkept pixie cut. Ehena-Marie, with unusually light her despite being half-japanese, wears a lopsided blue French bow. And an off shoulder blue tee shirt, a pair of brown khakis, and a pair of birkenstock boston clogs. They're both putting up stuff in the locker room, before the bell rings.</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( Being trans is not the most desireable or trendy thing. Especially if living in one of the more conservative states of what was once the American union. The best case, you risk being beaten up by other classmates, once they find out you're biologically male. The worst case they might even stab you with a knife, except with me they never messed with me, because of what my father's profession was, but for whatever reason Ehena never seemed like she knew. )<p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO-TOMATO</br />You never talk much about your father.</p>
<p class="dialogue">EHENA-MARIE</br />He hasn't been in my life for the past few months. So what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO-TOMATO</br />Well I usually have a family job after school.</p>
<p class="dialogue">EHENA-MARIE</br />Eh who cares about the family profession, come to Dance Dance Revolution club with me</p>
<p class="thoughtbubbles">( Ehena hands her a card, with some directions to the room with a Dance Dance Arcade.</p>
<p class="dialogue">HEMATO-TOMATO</br />Well I've never been a dancer.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 11. Trouble At Home</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Here we are in a ram shackle hourse, with broken windows, covered by broken blinders. Yet the darkness of the sky and red moon, gave the room an eerie glow. Here Ehena-Marie looks wearily and with fear at the attic, with a coffin that is in the attic.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew that her father was a douche bag, and from time to time she would have trouble with law enforcement.<p>
<p class="dialogue">Being an immigrant, it put her in a tricky situation do to Obama’s and later Trumps immigration policies.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I was one that she knew she could trust.
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 12. Waffle Restaurant, Song Waffle Irons</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato's Tomato, before he had the job of Guillotine execution he inherited from the last French execution, whom for immigrant reasons, himself could not conduct his operations in the united states, worked as a short order cook in the earliest hours of the morning between 3:00-5:00 A.M.</p>
<p class="dialogue">See, she knew that my dad dropped his job working as a short order cook.<p>
<p class="dialogue">Until of course was offered lots of money to cut people’s heads off for the state guillotine familla.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eventually it came down to this, we trusted each other more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="verse">WAFFLE IRONS</p>
<p class="verse">Its the waffle man,
<p class="verse">the man with the irons.
<p class="verse">Covered in syrup,
<p class="verse">Covered in its goop, darkness like iron.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Nothing like being a hot sticky mess,
<p class="verse">Made of boiled sugar and spice.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Its the waffle man,
<p class="verse">the man with the irons.
<p class="verse">Covered in syrup,
<p class="verse">Covered in its goop, darkness like iron.<br /><br />
<p class="verse">Would you like some sausage, with that waffle,
<p class="verse">Or would you like to be smashed, like a pancake.
<p class="verse">And baked in the fire.</p>
<h3 class="scenetitle">Scene 12. Ehena-Marie In Death</h3>
<p class="scenedescription">Hemato-Tomato has the corpse of Ehena-Marie unburied in a plot after finishing digging it up with shovels, and she is holding her girlfriend's severed head.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And, out of anything else, what bothers having you gone, my sweet, from this world. With my lust overpowering.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is the sensation of overwhelming despair. That feeling of hopelessness that only ever achieve full fruition once the love of my life is gone.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And no longer have the option to express it in a way others understand. But I am here with you now.</p>
<p class="verse">It was time to die:</p>
<p class="verse">Danse, the rhythms of death,</p>
<p class="verse">In this Kingdom by the hidden sea.</p>
<p class="verse">For me and my Anna-Marie.</p>
<p class="verse">The final epitaph of the damned.</p>
<p class="verse">For we are married in death.</p>
